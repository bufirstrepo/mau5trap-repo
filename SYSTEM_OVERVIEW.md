     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "Which artist has the best ROI?"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/v3/ai/analyze
   ```

## The Killer Features

**1. Merch Per Head Tracking**
This metric alone is worth gold. Shows which artists' fans actually buy merch.
- deadmau5: $20/head
- REZZ: $25/head (!)
- Optimize accordingly

**2. ROI Rankings**
Not just revenue - shows return on investment:
- BlackGummy: 8.7x ROI (invest more here!)
- deadmau5: 5.0x ROI (established, steady)

**3. Growth Rate**
- BlackGummy: 16% growth (rising star)
- REZZ: 9% growth (hot momentum)
- deadmau5: 2.5% (plateau, still profitable)

**4. Artist Rotation**
Genius way to keep everyone in the spotlight without neglecting anyone.

**5. AI Analysis**
Ask it ANYTHING about the label's business and get instant, data-backed answers.

## What Makes This Special

Most label analytics tools are either:
- **Too simple** (just streaming numbers)
- **Too expensive** ($10k/month enterprise tools)
- **Not customizable** (can't add your own metrics)

This is:
- **Comprehensive** (all revenue sources)
- **Affordable** (self-hosted, just API costs)
- **Customizable** (add any metric you want)
- **AI-powered** (Groq for actual insights)
- **Production-ready** (not a prototype)

## Next Steps

1. **Get a Groq API key** from console.groq.com
2. **Set up the backend** (follow QUICKSTART.md)
3. **Test everything** (use test-api.js)
4. **Demo to the team**
5. **Plan Phase 2** (connect real APIs)

## Support & Maintenance

This is designed to be:
- **Easy to maintain** (standard Node.js/Express)
- **Easy to extend** (add new endpoints easily)
- **Easy to deploy** (works on any Node.js host)
- **Well documented** (everything explained)
